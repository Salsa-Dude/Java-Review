// Encapsulation is the mechanism that allows you to restrict access to certain components in objects that you're creating
// Able to protect the members of a class from external access
// This allows other classes or code outside of the class from accessing the inner workings of a class.
// This also enables us to change things without breaking code elsewhere.

// problems without using encapsulation
// - We give access to change the fields directly
// - A change in a class variable or method name would lead us to need to update the new name everywhere in our application where its reference.
// - We don't have a way where the data in a class is valid.
// No way to validate
