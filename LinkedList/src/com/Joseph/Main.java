// Linked list is a alternative to arrays
// How it works is that it actually stores the actual link to the next item in the list
// - as well as the actual data so hence the name linked list.
// So in other words each element in the list actually holds a link to the item that
// - follows it, as well as the actual value you're wanting to actually store as well.
